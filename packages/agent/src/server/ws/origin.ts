/**
 * Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWSH) defense for the LAP WebSocket
 * upgrade surface.
 *
 * A WebSocket handshake is an ordinary cross-origin GET that is NOT
 * subject to the same-origin policy or CORS preflight. A malicious page
 * a logged-in user visits can therefore open `wss://app/agent/ws` with
 * the victim's ambient credentials unless the server validates the
 * `Origin` header itself. We do exactly that here, before handing the
 * socket to `handleUpgrade` / `acceptConnection`.
 *
 * Semantics:
 *
 *   - **No `Origin` header** → allow. Browsers always send `Origin` on a
 *     WebSocket handshake; a non-browser client (the `ws` library, a
 *     CLI, a server-to-server bridge) sends none. CSWSH requires a
 *     browser-driven cross-origin request, so an absent Origin can't be
 *     a CSWSH attack and must keep working for legitimate non-browser
 *     callers.
 *   - **`corsOrigins` configured** → the request `Origin` must be a
 *     member of the allowlist (exact string match), otherwise reject.
 *   - **`corsOrigins` not configured** → default to same-origin: the
 *     request `Origin` must equal the server's own origin (derived from
 *     the upgrade request URL).

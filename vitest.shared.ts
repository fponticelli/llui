import { defineConfig } from 'vitest/config'

// Shared vitest base for every package. Packages import this and `mergeConfig`
// it with ONLY their real deltas (environment, coverage, timeouts, …) so the
// common bits — the test glob and the build-time `__LLUI_*` define flags — stay
// in exactly one place and can't silently diverge between packages.
//
// `__LLUI_AGENT__` / `__LLUI_TRANSITIONS__` are compile-time defines that
// `@llui/vite-plugin` substitutes in real bundles based on the consumer's
// options. Vitest never runs through that plugin, so without a `define` these
// globals would be `undefined` (runtime guards read that as "off"). Pinning them
// to `'true'` here gives every package's tests the same, agent-active view of
// the runtime — the alternative (per-package defines) is exactly the silent
// divergence this base exists to prevent.
